### GPT

There are 2 fiels for GPT, one for the standard fine-tuning without preprocessing and the other incorporates the features into the final layer. These notebooks were run in Kaggle. The notebooks include the hyperparameters that produced thge best results, but note that some of the cell outputs were from later runs which were not the best. Simply run the cells in sequence to reproduce the output.
